## solidity notes

### gas

- every operation costs gas
  - gas estimates the cost of transaction, which can be evaluated in eth
- the gas limit should be reasonable so that transactions have enough gas to operate
- if gas limit is reached, transactions will roll back
- transaction cost- execution cost is the reward given to the validator

### state variables

- interacting with state variables is expensive in terms of gas, try to minimize this by using local caches.

### syntax

- the view keyword is used when a function does not modify the state variables


### ABI and bytecode

The byte code is the binary representation of the contract.
THe ABI is human readable text that represents the contract.

For example:

This contract results in this ABI.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 storedData;

    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

```json
[
    {
        "constant": false,
        "inputs": [
            {
                "name": "x",
                "type": "uint256"
            }
        ],
        "name": "set",
        "outputs": [],
        "payable": false,
        "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
        "type": "function"
    },
    {
        "constant": true,
        "inputs": [],
        "name": "get",
        "outputs": [
            {
                "name": "",
                "type": "uint256"
            }
        ],
        "payable": false,
        "stateMutability": "view",
        "type": "function"
    }
]
```
