## Problem 1

### state variables

- the owner of the project can call finalize a project
- voting power
  - the voting power of a person is determined by the sum of donations he made to the fund.
- everyone can create a project
  - some variables are created to maintain the votes casted on each project
  - a project can be finalized once 50% voting power is voted on it
    - but only the owner can call finalize()
- logging
  - some state variables are created for logging finalized projects and donation received
